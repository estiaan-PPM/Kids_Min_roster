# Kids Min sign-in

<p>The program opens up in the home page. For the user to start taking attendance they need to click on the "New Attendance List" button. This will allow the user to add the sign-ins to the database for that date.</p>
<p>The search bar uses the child's name to find the child but also other children with the same name and all other children with the same guardian.</p>
<p>A counter will be displayed just below the search bar to show that amount of children in attendance.</p>
<p>Using the tabs at the top for the different classes shows the children in attendance for that day. In that page there is also a counter to indicate the size of the class. The page displays the child's name, their birthday, primary guardian, home languages and any allergies that they may have. If you desire more information on the child, just click on the child's currently displayed information, this will open up and display all information that we have on the child.</p>

## Editing Child information
<p>If you find that any information on the child is incorrect, just click on their infomation in their info page and you can edit any information necessary.</p>

## Adding a New Child  
<p>If a new child joins Kids Min, click the "Add New" tab at the top and a new form will open up for them. If the parent already has a child in Kids Min, then they only need to fill in their phone number under the "Guardian Information" section and their information will then be linked to that child.</p>

## Viewing Past Attendance Lists
<p>In the Home Page press the "Retrieve Attendance Lists" button. A new page should open up with only a select box and a button. Use the select box to choose the date that you wish to see the attendance of and press the "filter" button. A counter with the amount of children in attendance should appear at the top, followed by a list of every child that attended on that day.</p>
